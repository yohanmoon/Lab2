Basic styles
------------
With this markup you can obtain *simple emhpasis* (usually rendered in italic text), **strong emphasis** (usually rendered in bold text), `source code` text (usually rendered in monospaced text), or ~~strikethrough~~ text (usually rendered with a line through text).
You may use also _this_ or __this__ notation to emphatize text, and you can use all them _**`together`**_ (and you can mix `*` and `_` )
If you look at the source code you may note that
even
if
you
break
the
lines,
the text is kept together
in a single paragraph
Paragraphs are delimited by blank lines, leading and trailing spaces are removed
You may force a line break with two spaces
or with a `\`\
at the end
